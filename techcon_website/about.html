                    Spirituality and Professional Success
The training includes:
1. Fundamentals: Here Principle of non-duality is taught which is the foundational principle for every area of life. The states of consciousness are explained to understand how people experience life and what state is a peak performance state that can give maximum output is discussed.
2. Problem definition: In the problem definition part obstacles are discussed. What obstacles cause poor performance? What is the root cause of poor performance? Clarity is built about why people are not able to perform to their best.
3. Solution and implementation: This is the most important part where a solution is created based on the science we studied for the problem we defined. Also how to implement the solution practically is taught.
It includes interactive exercises, meditation techniques, homework exercises, and separate question-answer sessions for any doubts the audience may have. The training is not just giving the information but it’s more fun enjoyable learning.
